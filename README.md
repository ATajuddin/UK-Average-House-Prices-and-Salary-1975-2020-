UK Average House Prices and Salary (1975-2020).    Adjusted by inflation.    About Dataset Context  Demand for houses has exploded in the UK in the last two years due to the pandemic. As a result, it feels like it is becoming more difficult for young people to afford to buy a house in the near future. I wanted to collect data to see if this sentiment is backed up by numbers.  Content  In this folder you will find the average house price in the UK between between 1975 and 2020, the median wage in the UK between 1999 and 2020. Both of these metrics have been adjusted by inflation up to 2020.  This folder also contains a table containing data on the wage gap in 2021, in the UK and by age group.
